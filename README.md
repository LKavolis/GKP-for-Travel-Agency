# GKP-for-Travel-Agency

Task: You run a travel agency that focuses on all-inclusive trips around Europe. You need to build a plan on how to grow revenue through organic traffic.
Prepare a plan on how to achieve that. It needs to include:
Pick 5 services/locations you will serve and identify primary commercial keywords for them.
Using the SEO research process identify 10 content pages to build.
All keywords need to have search volume and CPC associated with them (use the United Kingdom as a region).
For each page, write SEO optimized title, meta description, url-slug.
Prepare 1 content brief for one of your content pages (blogs)
